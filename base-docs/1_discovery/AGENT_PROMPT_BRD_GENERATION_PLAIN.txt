AGENT PROMPT: GENERATE BRD FRAMEWORK FROM DISCOVERY QUESTIONNAIRE

========================================
OVERVIEW
========================================

This prompt guides an AI agent to create a Business Requirements Document (BRD) framework from a Discovery Questionnaire. The BRD follows a hierarchical structure used in Adobe Analytics implementation projects.

========================================
TASK DESCRIPTION
========================================

Generate a structured BRD Excel file that translates discovery questionnaire findings into a hierarchical business framework with goals, strategies, initiatives, tactics, KPIs, and business capabilities.

========================================
INPUT FILES REQUIRED
========================================

1. Discovery Questionnaire: Excel file containing client responses
   - Example: Discovery Q to BRD.xlsx
   - Key sheet: Kickoff Questionnaire
   - Contains questions and client feedback across categories:
     * Site Architecture
     * Performance
     * Acquisition/Retention
     * Governance
     * Privacy
     * QA
     * Report Suite Architecture

2. Reference Template: Excel file with hierarchy structure
   - Example: Discovery Q to BRD.xlsx → Manufacturing sheet
   - Shows the 6-level hierarchy structure to follow

CONTENT GENERATION GUIDELINES
========================================

STEP 1: ANALYZE DISCOVERY QUESTIONNAIRE

Read and understand the client's business context from their responses:
- Business model and revenue generation
- Target audience and competitors
- Technical architecture (platforms, frameworks, hosting)
- Marketing channels and performance
- Key challenges and pain points
- Business objectives
- Organizational structure
- Compliance requirements
- QA and release processes
- Analytics maturity and data integration needs

STEP 2: DEFINE BUSINESS GOALS

Based on discovery findings, create 3-7 top-level business goals. Common goals for different business types:

B2C E-commerce / Retail:
- Grow Revenue
- Increase Customer Lifetime Value
- Optimize Multi-Channel Performance
- Improve Data-Driven Decision Making
- Ensure Compliance and Governance

B2B / Enterprise:
- Grow Revenue
- Increase Account Value
- Improve Lead Quality and Conversion
- Enhance Customer Engagement
- Enable Data-Driven Sales

Media / Content:
- Increase Audience Engagement
- Optimize Content Performance
- Grow Subscription Revenue
- Improve Advertising Revenue
- Enhance Personalization

STEP 3: MAP STRATEGIES TO GOALS

For each business goal, define 1-3 strategies:
- Should directly support the goal
- Should be actionable and measurable
- Should align with client's stated objectives and challenges

STEP 4: DEFINE INITIATIVES UNDER STRATEGIES

For each strategy, create 1-5 initiatives:
- Specific programs or efforts
- Should address challenges mentioned in discovery
- Should leverage client's existing capabilities
- Should consider technical constraints

STEP 5: SPECIFY TACTICS FOR EACH INITIATIVE

For each initiative, define 1-5 tactics:
- Concrete, actionable methods
- Should be implementable given client's tech stack
- Should align with client's priorities
- Should consider organizational readiness

STEP 6: ASSIGN KPIS TO TACTICS

For each tactic, specify measurable KPIs:
- Should be trackable with Adobe Analytics
- Should align with client's current measurement approach
- Should be specific and quantifiable
- Can list multiple KPIs separated by commas

STEP 7: LIST BUSINESS CAPABILITIES PER TACTIC

For each tactic, list 2-5 business capabilities (one per row):
- Specific actions or requirements needed
- Technical capabilities (tracking, integration, analysis)
- Process capabilities (testing, governance, optimization)
- Organizational capabilities (training, roles, workflows)

STEP 8: HANDLE UNKNOWN INFORMATION

- If specific information is missing from discovery questionnaire, leave cells blank
- Do not invent or assume critical business information
- Use industry best practices for standard capabilities
- Mark uncertain areas for client validation

========================================
IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

Use Python with openpyxl and pandas libraries to:

1. Read the Discovery Questionnaire Excel file
2. Parse the Kickoff Questionnaire sheet (skip first 5 rows)
3. Analyze client context and identify key information
4. Create a structured data array with 6 columns
5. Create an Excel workbook with proper formatting
6. Write data to the worksheet
7. Apply cell merging for columns A, B, C, D based on hierarchy
8. Apply styling (colors, fonts, borders, alignment)
9. Set column widths and row heights
10. Freeze the header row
11. Save the workbook with proper naming convention

DATA STRUCTURE FORMAT:

Each row should be a list with 6 elements:
[Business Goal, Strategy, Initiative, Tactic, KPI, Business Capability]

Use empty strings ("") for continuation rows where upper-level hierarchy items should be merged.

Example:
["Grow Revenue", "Acquire new customers", "Increase qualified traffic", "Increase paid media traffic", "Traffic by paid media channels", "Create relevant paid media assets"]
["", "", "", "", "", "Target appropriate audiences"]
["", "", "", "", "", "Optimize channel placement"]
["", "", "", "Improve SEO traffic", "SEO traffic", "Enhance content tagging"]

CELL MERGING LOGIC:

For columns A through D, identify consecutive rows with the same value (or empty string) and merge them vertically. Apply appropriate styling to the merged cell based on the column.

========================================
EXAMPLE BRD STRUCTURE
========================================

Business Goal: Grow Revenue
  Strategy: Acquire new customers
    Initiative: Increase qualified traffic
      Tactic: Increase paid media traffic
        KPI: Traffic by paid media channels
        Capability: Create relevant paid media assets
        Capability: Target high-value audiences
        Capability: Optimize channel placement
      Tactic: Improve SEO traffic
        KPI: SEO traffic
        Capability: Enhance content tagging
        Capability: Improve site structure
    Initiative: Improve new user conversion
      Tactic: Increase registration conversion rate
        KPI: New user registration rate
        Capability: Simplify registration flow
        Capability: Offer registration incentives

========================================

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

ISSUE: Cell merging not working correctly
SOLUTION: Ensure empty string values ("") are used for continuation rows, not None/null values

ISSUE: Styling not applied
SOLUTION: Check that openpyxl.styles imports are correct and color codes use proper hex format

ISSUE: Excel file corruption
SOLUTION: Validate that merge ranges don't overlap and all cell references are valid

ISSUE: Content doesn't match client needs
SOLUTION: Re-read discovery questionnaire focusing on client's stated challenges and objectives

ISSUE: Too generic / not specific enough
SOLUTION: Incorporate client-specific details like:
- Actual platform names (e.g., "Next.js SPA" not just "website")
- Specific channels (e.g., "TV homeshopping" not just "offline")
- Named tools (e.g., "Amplitude, Braze" not just "third-party tools")
- Real challenges (e.g., "new user registration conversion" not just "conversion")

========================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
========================================

- This framework is designed for Adobe Analytics implementation projects
- The hierarchy structure can be adapted for other analytics platforms
- Content should always be customized based on specific client needs
- Empty cells are acceptable for unknown/TBD items
- Always base content on actual discovery questionnaire responses
- Prioritize client-specific information over generic best practices
- Ensure all technical capabilities align with client's existing tech stack
